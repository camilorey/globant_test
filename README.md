# Data Scientist Technical test for Globant

This is the repository I created to do the Technical Test for Globant featuring an exploration of Purchase Card Transactions. There are three files in this Repo: 2 Notebooks and 1 huge CSV file. Here's a brief description of the files:

1. data_gathering_and_cleanup.ipynb : the Notebook I used to download file sources and construct a single CSV dataset. 
2. data_analysis_general.ipynb: the Notebook I used to do the Analysis. 
3. credit_card_transactions.csv: The dataset that I used for the Analysis.
4. file_sources.xls: an auxiliary Excel File that I used to download files from the Birmingham City Council records.
